## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using _ before SASS filename means that it will not be compiled as CSS, which is useful because I wanted SASS to compile into one file so there are fewer http requests.
- Explored using clamp for more dynamic font sizes and widths. A strange CSS feature which appears to require tuning by eye.
- It didn't take me so long to complete this challenge as some others.
